****  When you save the game, default back to the regular shot so we don't get a weird case where the player gets a gun, dies and loses it, but can still shoot it until they swap weapons.
***Fly Generator much too strong
***On fire weapon pick up the weapon is selected but doesn't fire.
***Shoot robot is a little off the floor
